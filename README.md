# Slack Bot

A Slack bot written in Elixir. Based upon the IRC bot by Jeff Weiss (OHaiBot).


## Config

There are only a few configuration variables to manage. The configuration file is according to your environment (e.g., `prod` or `dev`). Edit the `config/dev.secret.exs` accordingly. Example configurations are provided, so just rename them to .exs instead of .exs.example.
